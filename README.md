# PLANTATION-MONITORING-SYSTEM-BASED-ON-IOT
Using an automated Plantation Monitoring system based on IOT reduces the farmers presence for irrigation which is the major part of the practice of farming and optimizes the usage of water by reducing the wastage of water. The proposed controller eliminates the manual switching mechanism used by the farmers. The use of this system will be able to contribute to the socio-economic development of the nation.

Plantation monitoring system model was created in proteus and has been implemented using hardware system.
**Componenets used**: NodeMCU, Soil Moisture Sensor, DHT 11, Relay, 5V DC Water Pump, 9V Battery, Jumper Wires
